                Alright. Confession time. This page title is very misleading. I don't offer packages and I don't list pricing.
                Stick with me I have good reason. Quick story: I gave a speech at a high school that serves primarily impoverished kids.
                The speech was basically how to inspire girls into STEM. One question a parent asked me is "my daughter is bad at math,
                she's scared she won't be able to make it." I encouraged the parent to tell her daughter not to stress about math, its all about practice.
                I brought up tutoring and the parent said "the school offers additional help but I can't afford to hire someone." I kept my composure until I
                got in my car. Then I got really sad.
                <br>
                <br>
                The private tutoring companies I have worked for charged between $55-$85 / hour. One of them charged students by the minute. True story. I reject
                the idea that personalized tutoring is only for the privileged. Especially now with all of the uncertainty around school.   
                <br>
                <br>
                So here is how this will work. Lets talk. Message me and tell me what you need. Tough class? Lets try to meet once a week.
                Just need an intense study session for a test? Lets hit the books! Need something in between? Lets work that out. This is why I don't want to offer packages.
                There is no one size fits all.

                <h2 style="color:#414770">Pricing</h2>
                <p>
                <br>
                For now I am offering a pay as you go / pay what you can situation. Availability is going to be limited as I have a day job and a pretty busy family life. It
                will also be first come first serve. No worries on if "pay what you can" means $1 or $2 dollars. The only time I will charge a minimum is if I have to travel,
                and right now that is not even an option.
